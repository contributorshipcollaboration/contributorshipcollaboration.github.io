The goal of the _Contributorship Collaboration_ is to make curating and reporting scholarly contributions easier, more transparent, and more inclusive.

Our first tool, the [tenzing.club](tenzing.club) web app and associated R package were developed to facilitate researcher reporting of contributorship information in manuscripts and journal articles. tenzing.club is named after the Nepali-Indian Sherpa Tenzing Norgay, who was one of the two individuals who reached the summit of Mount Everest for the first time. Despite his essential contribution, traditionally the achievement was less credited to him than to his partner, the New Zealand mountaineer Edmund Hillary.
