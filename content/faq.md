# How to make the CRediT information machine-readable in a journal?

Most journals use a paper submission system provided by the publisher of the journal. These submission systems are designed to collect the journal article metadata (such as the names and affiliations of the authors, the abstract of the paper) from the corresponding author and store them in a machine-readable file. Most systems use the [Journal Article Tag Suite XML](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/1.3/) format to append these metadata in an organized manner to the journal article published online. While the latest JATS 1.3 format allows for recording author contributions according to CRediT in the article metadata not all submission systems collect authors contributions. PLOS journals are collecting this information as metadata through a form.
