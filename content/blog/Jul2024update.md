As we continue to finalize translations of CRediT into various languages (see all the finished ones [here](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/completed/)!), we have begun to turn our
attention toward making journals and publishers aware of our translations and helping people use them.

## Translation and outreach

We have begun to email the editors of journals that publish in the languages of our translations, thanks to having two or three more hackathons over the last few months

If you know of journals, scientific societies, or publishers working in languages other than English that might be able to make use of a CRediT translation, 
let us know and we'd love to have your help in contacting them to spread the good news about CRediT.
But we're not just about CRediT, we also like to make people aware more generally of the concept of contributorship and getting beyond
the artificial constraints of traditional authorship practices.

You can register your interest in this at the [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdhqlnk4sw61MkkDuufZyqO1SKmnp--QE6vEG1_7qnP9MzJg/viewform?usp=sf_link).

## Implementing CRediT in OJS

Thanks to a [small grant](https://experiment.com/projects/let-s-increase-scientific-collaboration-by-giving-scientists-the-credit-they-deserve) 
from the Experiment Foundation/Schmidt Futures, we have been able to work with Open Journal Systems /PKP to facilitate implementing CRediT in the open source Open
Journal Systems, which is used by thousands of journals, especially free diamond open access journals and those in the Global South.

Register your interest in using the plugin, or helping with the project, [here](https://forms.gle/HHc5HJErd99ktvhJ9) - 
we are especially looking for researchers/editors associated with journals that use OJS.

Oh, another way to help would be to just [give money to the project](https://opencollective.com/tenzing) :smiley: .

## Moving forward

Other projects we have initiated include:

*  Creating a FAQ to answer common questions about CRediT, conceptual, practical, and technical
*  Advocating that journals start giving CRediT to non-author contributors, mainly people traditionally listed in the Acknowledgments.

We have periodic online hackathons to discuss and work on these issues, follow us on Mastodon to find out about those and more, [@tenzingContrib@neuromatch.social](https://neuromatch.social/@tenzingContrib).
