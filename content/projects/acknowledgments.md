description: Enhance the credit received by people listed in article Acknowledgments

We are working to increase the career credit that 
acknowledgees (people listed in the Acknowledgments sections of research papers) receive.

You can express interest in joining the project here:

One concrete step is to add ORCID numbers of acknowledgees, so that scholarly databases can index them.
