description: Enhance the credit received by people listed in article Acknowledgments
---

In this project, we are working to increase the career credit that 
acknowledgees (people listed in the Acknowledgments sections of research papers) receive.

One concrete step we are advocating for is adding ORCID numbers of acknowledgees to disambiguate their identities so that scholarly databases can index them.
