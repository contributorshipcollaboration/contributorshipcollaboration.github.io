CRediT is a NISO standard for indicating who did what in the projects associated with scientific journal articles. It is a [taxonomy of 14 different roles](https://credit.niso.org).

Our translations into over 35 languages are in machine-readable form in [this repository](https://github.com/contributorshipcollaboration/credit-translation) 
 for journals to use. Our code renders them into human-readable form [here](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/completed/).

If you use one of our translations, please consider citing our preprint, now under review by [MetaROR](MetaROR.org): Holcombe, A. O., Kovacs, M., Lagisz, M., Sætrevik, B., Pollo, P., Kochetkov, D., Pedersen, R., Mićunović, D., Mewded, B., Sabet, S. S., Færøvik, U., Yu, W. K., Vaidis, D. C., Santana, E. M., Trubanová, N., Varga, M. A., Surendran, A., Čulina, A., Akogwu, C. O., … Popova, N. (2025). Facilitating multilingual research publishing: Translations of the Contributor Roles Taxonomy (CRediT).

 ## Background

CRediT is being used by thousands of journals, but officially it is available only in English. While English is the lingua franca of science, thousands of journals that publish in other languages still exist and many serve important roles for their associated language communities.

There will never be official NISO standard translations, because NISO does not do translations, or even endorse particular translations done by others. But they do recognize the value of translations and have encouraged others to create translations!

We started with a [hackathon at Big Team Science 2023](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/blog/translation/), and continued working together to yield translations in [dozens of languages](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/completed/).

At least two humans fluent in the language were involved in each translation.
