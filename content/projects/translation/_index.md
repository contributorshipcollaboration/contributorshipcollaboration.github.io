CRediT is a NISO standard for indicating who did what in the projects associated with scientific journal articles. It is a taxonomy of 14 different roles.

CRediT is being used by hundreds, if not thousands, of journals, but officially it is available only in English. While English is the lingua franca of science, thousands of journals that publish in other languages still exist and many serve important roles for their associated language communities.

There will never be official NISO standard translations, because NISO does not do translations, or even endorse particular translations done by others. Nevertheless, they recognize the value of translations and have encouraged us to do translations.

Many volunteers came together at our [hackathon at Big Team Science 2023](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/blog/translation/), so we currently have draft translations into more than 8 languages, including Chinese, Spanish, Japanese, and German.
As we enter the translations in machine-readable form in [this repository](https://github.com/contributorshipcollaboration/credit-translation) 
 for journals to use, our code also renders the translations into human-readable form [here](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/completed/).
