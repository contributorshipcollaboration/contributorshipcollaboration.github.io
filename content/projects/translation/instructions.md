**Our mission:** Make CRediT more inclusive by translating it into other languages, and assist communities to adopt CRediT.

## üß±  Translation contributions 

Anyone fluent in a language not already translated can help provide a new translation, or propose a change to an existing translation.

Before starting on a new translation:

* Check if the  translation for your language has been [completed](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/completed/)
* Fill out our Expression of Interest (EOI) [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdhqlnk4sw61MkkDuufZyqO1SKmnp--QE6vEG1_7qnP9MzJg/viewform?usp=sf_link) to get in touch.


## Contributing to other facets of the project (we'd love your help!)

* Programming or code checking: check the Github issues or email us
* Outreach and implementation 
 * Contact scientific societies and scientific publishers who publish in these languages
* Organize a hackathon ad hoc or at a scientific conference
* For any of the above, fill out our Expression of Interest (EOI) [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdhqlnk4sw61MkkDuufZyqO1SKmnp--QE6vEG1_7qnP9MzJg/viewform?usp=sf_link) or email (aoholcombe@gmail.com) to get in touch

# üíù  Acknowledgement of contributions   

## Translation contributors 

Contributors will be recognized in that their names will appear in the attribution for the translation they helped create. For example, see the [human-readable page for German](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/projects/translation/translations/credit_translation_de/).

Unfortunately we don't have funds to remunerate anyone for their work :(

<!-- All project participants who contributed any amount of work, and provided their details, will be acknowledged as project contributors on the project page, report, presentations, and manuscript. We will mainly use a CRediT-like statement format, but we will also keep a more detailed record of individual contributions to specific tasks within the stages of the project. This record will be also made publicly availabe as part of the open project materials (as a publicly available dataset). You can request to have your details removed or obscured at any time.    -->

## üìÑ Co-authorship (or, should that be co-*contributorship*? üòÄ)
Project participants with substantial and high-quality contributions (as defined below) will become co-authors of the manuscript.
They will contribute to any or all of these: translation, checking, website code, coordination, and/or report drafting.   
  
IMPORTANT: Authorship is also coditional on reading and approving the final manuscript draft before submission and providing all personal information (e.g., name, affiliation, email) needed for the submission.     

Additional contribution oportunities may be available.

First and last author positions are reserved for the project leads (they could be co-first and co-last positions). Subsequent authorship positions will be determined by the total amount and quality of contributions, as in the project records. For equal contributions the order of mid-authorship will be alphabetic. All authors must read and approve the final manuscript draft before submission. The manuscript will contain a CRediT statement detailing the roles of individual authors and contributors.   

# üìç Final notes   
Project leads reserve the right to interpret and change the contribution rules at any time, if such need arises. In case of any disputes decisions of project leads will be final.
